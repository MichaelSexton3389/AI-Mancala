# AI-Mancala
This is a version of Mancala with a slightly different ruleset. I created this project in order to satisfy a project credit in a course, however, I decided to write all of the code in the project myself instead of utilizing pre-existing packages that achieve the same outcome.

This project reinforced my learning of state graphs and trees and helped me put into practice some of the algorithms I learned in the course. In addition I learned a lot about optimization and how crucial it is as a problem grows. I found that without the utilization of an Alpha-Beta pruning optimization technique, the simulations of AI vs Random player took 30 minutes to simulate only 25 games, (depth of 5 for the Minimax). Meannwhile, utilizing the pruning optimize this simulation by 65%.

I'm very happy with the finished product and the code is available to run. I worked on the code entirely in jupyter notebook which is why the commit history is empty however I wanted to show of this project so I've put it here on github.
