# Mancala with Custom Ruleset
This is a custom implementation of the classic Mancala game with a slightly modified ruleset. I originally created this project to fulfill a course project credit, but rather than using existing libraries, I chose to write all the code from scratch. This approach allowed me to gain deeper insight into game mechanics, algorithms, and optimizations.

## Learning Outcomes
Working on this project reinforced my understanding of state graphs and trees, as well as various search and optimization algorithms. Some key takeaways include:

- Implementing the Minimax algorithm for AI decision-making.

- Understanding the importance of optimization in AI-based simulations.

- Applying Alpha-Beta pruning to improve efficiency significantly.

One of the biggest challenges I encountered was the sheer computational complexity of evaluating game states. Initially, running 25 AI vs. Random player simulations (with a Minimax depth of 5) took 30 minutes. After integrating Alpha-Beta pruning, I was able to reduce the computation time by 65%, making the AI simulation much more efficient.

## About the Code
The entire project was developed in Jupyter Notebook, which is why the commit history may appear sparse. Despite this, I wanted to showcase the project and make the code available for others to explore.

Feel free to check out the implementation and experiment with the game!
